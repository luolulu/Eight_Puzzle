NAME:LU LUO UIN:226003066

This is a program of 6 search algorithm to solve 8 puzzle.

The entrance of main function is in the eight.java
There are 6 search algorithm are DFSearch, BFSearch, IDSearch, Greedy, AStarSearch and IDAStarSearch, all these algorithm are in the function of Problemsolver.java.

===============
==== Usage ====
===============
The direction of this program:

Breadth-first ('bfs')

Depth-first search ('dfs')

Iterative Deepening Search('ids')

Gready best-first search(‘greedy’)

A* Search ( ‘A1’ means outofplace or ‘A2’ means manhattan )
IDA* Search(‘IDA2’ means manhattan or ‘IDA1’ means outofplace)

Compilation:
	javac eight.java

Example usage for bfs:
	java  ProblemSolver -d bfs 1 3 4 8 6 2 7 0 5
Example usage for dfs:
	java -Xmx1024m ProblemSolver dfs 1 3 4 8 6 2 7 0 5

Same usage for other algorithm

there have some circumstances we get no result from some search algorithm because of out of memory.
